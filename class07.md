# Class 07

global functions out side of objects are a good idea, call these helper functions

before creating a brand new object list out all the values needed

For 201 send pull request link before merge with master

build a function one at a time and then prove that it works

for loops first build logic of a single statement then build loop around that and make work for loop

Loops and Function all have their own scope so reusing variables between them is not a problem.

constructors and classes start with capital letter, variables start with a lower case

Prototype frees up methods from being inside the constructor but connected to the constructor.
far more efficient memory wise

Dynamic Populations, built with JS

all hours in a for loop
each row in it's own function

1 funtion for header row
1 function for store rows all 5 in one or one for each
1 footer row function


For Lab 07 create 3 functions
