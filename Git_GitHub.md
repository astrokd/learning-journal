## Version Control

A Git is a snapshot in time of files and code.  Git tracks changes of files and code as you work.  Git and GitHub help minimize loss of data.

## Setting up a Git Repo

To setup a Git Repository you must first use the git command
    ```git init```

This creates a git in the *current working directory*, several folders that help git know this is a folder are placed inside.

Then you start tracking by performing your initial commit with the command
    ```git add```
And then
    ```git commit -m "a message"```

## Workflow

Check File Status with command
    ```git status```
