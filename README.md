# Kevin Dreyer's codefellows Learning Journal

Hi, I was previously a **IT Technical Support professional**, I've been in Technical Support and Software Testing for a software company, and I went to engineering school before that.  I've been interested in learning more about coding for some time and have been learning on my own using TreeHouse.com, Lynda.com, and others.  I recently decided that I needed to step-up my training experience and be in group learning environment.

#### Growth Mindset

*(https://www.atlassian.com/blog/inside-atlassian/growth-mindset)*

> The growth mindset can open pathways to more creativity and possibility, and enable the setting of higher goals and more achievement.

Growth Mindset is the idea that learning is a growth process where *mistakes, errors, and obsticales* are all part of the process.

A fixed mindset would be the opposite of that where you finding difficulty or make mistakes and use this experience as a reason to not continue.


#### Reminders

1. Learn from others and celabrate their success
2. When it gets hard persist
3. Don't ignore criticism
