Hi, I was previously a **IT Technical Support professional**, I've been in Technical Support and Software Testing for a software company, and I went to engineering school before that.  I've been interested in learning more about coding for some time and have been learning on my own using TreeHouse.com, Lynda.com, and others.  I recently decided that I needed to step-up my training experience and be in group learning environment.
