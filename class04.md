# Class 04
> Never clone a repo inside a repo

let is a different way of saying var
const is a another way of saying var, it is not reassignable
Use var for on until you fully understand why let and const exist.

Number('') converts a string to number

Break stops a loop, also acceptable method to exiting a loop
Continue stops a interation

AnArray.includes(string) returns boolean don't use unless you know what it does

AnArray[#] returns a member of an array
AnArray returns all members of an array

the == comparison is a less strict letting you compare a string to number  '2' == 2 is true  because of type conversion.

Always use a strict equal ===.

Global varaiables are vars not contained inside a function, anything can use it even things in another file

Global varaiables can cause issues and C#, Java, and Python don't allow them.

Call function below where you declare it

**forking a repo**
forking puts someone elses GitHub repo into your github 

clone the forked repo to your computer

ACP changes back to my repo on github

pull request chamges back to orginal github repo
