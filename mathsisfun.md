## Exponents
A exponent is the number that says how many times a number is multipled by itself for example:
 8<sup>2</sup>

Says multiple 8 twice, or 8 x 8, 8 to the power of 2

## Logarithms
> How many of one number do we multiply to get another number?
The log of 8 with base 2 is 3

log<sub>2</sub>(8) = 3

Exponents and Logarithms are related

## Polynomials
> Polynomial comes from poly- (meaning "many") and -nomial (in this case meaning "term") ... so it says "many terms"

This is a polynomial: 4xy<sup>2</sup> + 3x - 5

#### Polynomials can have

- Constants
- Variables
- Exponents

#### Polynomials cannot have

- negative exponents  3xy<sup>-2</sup>
- dividing by a constant  2 / x + 2
- fractional exponents of a constant

There a special names for polynomials with 1, 2, or 3 terms.  Monomial => 1 , Binomial => 2 , Trinomial => 3

## Functions
A function relates an input to an output

> "`f(x) = ... `" is the classic way of writing a function.

Domain maps to Range
Argument maps to Value of Function
