  Text Editors are tools that help you make and edit code.  Using a Text Editor over other text editing tools can help improve your coding experience.  Text Editors do this by using the follow technicques.

    - As you start typing the editor gives you a list of possible commands for the languages you are coding in.  This allows you to code faster and make fewer mistakes.
