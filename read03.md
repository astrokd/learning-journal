# Read 03: HTML Lists, CSS Boxes, JS Control Flow

## From the Duckett HTML book:

Chapter 3: “Lists” (pp.62-73)
Chapter 13: “Boxes” (pp.300-329)

## From the Duckett JS book:

Chapter 4: “Decisions and Loops” from switch statements on (pp.162-182)

### Switch Statements
Switch statements live in one code block inside curly brackets.  Switch statements have a defaulkt value if none of the statements evauate as true.

IF...ELSE vs SWITCH
Switch statements have a break so once a condition is meet they leave the statment providing better performance, IF ELSE each statement is checked no matter what.

### Type Coercion
strings can be converted to numbers in expressions, for example `'1' > 0` is evauluated as true.

### Truthy and Falsy Values
The existence of a value is considered truthy

Falsy values are things like;
 ``` JS
 var score = false; //boolean false
 var score = 0;  //number zero
 var score = '';  //empty value
 var score = 10/'score';  //NaN
 var score;  // no value
 ```
